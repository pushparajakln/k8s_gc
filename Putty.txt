XQuartz installation for putty

Sudo port install putty

Cp /opt/local/bin/putty ~/Desktop/PuTTY

Open XQuartz and type putty


For XQuartz copy paste option:

You need to middle-click to paste the contents of the OS X Pasteboard (as the X11 settings call it.) If you don't have a middle mouse button, 
turn on "Emulate three button mouse" in the X11 Preferences under the "Input" tab, 
along with "Enable syncing" and "Update PRIMARY when Pasteboard changes" under the "Pasteboard" tab. 
Then you can paste whatever you copied in the rest of Mac OS X by holding down Option and clicking.
